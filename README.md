# New York City MTA Turnstile Data

For this project I was tasked with analyzing Metro Transit Authority (MTA) data in the New York City metro area. The insights from this analysis would be used to assist a nonprofit client in sending out street teams to various MTA train stations to advocate for an upcoming WomenTechWomenYes gala being held at the beginning of summer.

The results from this analysis not only provide insights into which MTA stations in the New York City metro area experience the greatest number of daily entries but more specifically help identify which days of the week will have the greatest foot traffic. Sending street teams out to the MTA stations identified as having the greatest number of daily entries during weekdays will allow WomenTechWomenYes to promote their gala to the greatest number of individuals as well as to target residents living and working in the New York City area who are more likely to attend the event.
